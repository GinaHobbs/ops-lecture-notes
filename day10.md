# Data Backups and Imaging

Bare Metal restoration = restore data without needing any previous installed software.

Imaging = great for taking a snapshot of a computer system.

Imaging is different that a differential, incremental or full backup. It stores everything about a computer, including the system setting of the OS and the files on it- everything. Because of this the file is larger than a backup, but it can be used to rapidly setup a computer with a lot of the programs preconfigured and with data in place.
